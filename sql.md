SQL
===

All sql saved words should be capitalized. 

Example: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`

If query isnâ€™t short to be in 1 line, put every part of the query on a new line:
```
SELECT *
FROM y
WHERE z=1
```
 
__Joins:__

use the inner/outer/left/right join syntax to join tables

Example:
```
FROM x
INNER JOIN y ON x.id = y.id
```
 
__Table aliases:__

Avoid using table aliases for ease of readability.
